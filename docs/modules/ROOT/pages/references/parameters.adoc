= Parameters

The parent key for all of the following parameters is `openshift4_version`.

== `spec`

type:: object

[source,yaml]
----
channel: stable-4.8
clusterID: ${openshift:clusterID}
upstream: https://api.openshift.com/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph
----

See the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/updating/updating-cluster-between-minor.html[OpenShift docs] for available paramters and values.

The `clusterID` is supposed to be extracted from the cluster as a fact.
The tools of project Syn don't yet allow to do so.
For now, this behavior gets mimicked by setting the parameter `openshift.clusterID` instead.

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  openshift:
    clusterID: '6d8329e3-7098-4bab-b7d8-11f1dc353481'

  openshift4_version:
    spec:
      desiredUpdate:
        force: false
        image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:7613d8f7db639147b91b16b54b24cfa351c3cbde6aa7b7bf1b9c80c260efad06
        version: 4.4.6
----

[NOTE]
====
This example assumes that `openshift4_version.spec.clusterID` is set to `${openshift.clusterID}` somewhere in the inventory.
Due to https://github.com/projectsyn/commodore/issues/138, this can not yet be done in the defaults.
